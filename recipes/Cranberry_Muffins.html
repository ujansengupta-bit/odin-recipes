        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These cranberry muffins are moist and tangy with a slight citrus accent, thanks to orange zest and orange juice. 
            Fresh cranberries are naturally tart so if you prefer a sweeter muffin, add more sugar or used dried cranberries.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar or more to taste</li>
            <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 cup orange juice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon orange zest</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups fresh cranberries</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
                 Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners.</li>
            <li>Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into a bowl.

</li>
            <li>Beat sugar and vegetable oil in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light in color and well blended, about 3 minutes. 
                Add egg and beat until smooth. Mix in orange juice and zest.</li>
            <li>Add flour mixture in batches, stirring until just combined. Fold in cranberries.</li>
            <li>Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full.

</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops until tops are golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
                 Cool muffins in the pan briefly before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

</li>
        </ol>
