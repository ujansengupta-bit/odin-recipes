            <li>1 whole chicken, giblets removed</li>
            <li>5 carrots, chopped</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons dried dill weed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter, or to taste (Optional)</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon ground thyme</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>

        <h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with 4 quarts water. Add chicken; bring to a boil. Cook until chicken meat easily falls off the bone, about 45 minutes.
                 Remove chicken to a platter and cover with plastic wrap. Cover the pot with a lid. 
                 Refrigerate chicken and broth until chicken is cool enough to handle, about 40 minutes.

</li>
            <li>Remove meat from chicken bones; set aside. Skim excess fat off the top of cooled broth.</li>
            <li>Add remaining 2 quarts water, chicken meat, carrots, celery, onion, cabbage, wine, bouillon, dill, butter, parsley, thyme, garlic, white pepper, and bay leaves to broth in the pot. 
                Cook over medium heat until vegetables have softened, about 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
